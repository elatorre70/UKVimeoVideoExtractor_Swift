There's always more to explore, and we encourage you to play with the sample project, or dive right into the code and try it out yourself. Most of our classes and functions are decently documented in the source files, so more detail on any topic can be found there. If you still have questions or you're running into trouble, feel free to file an issue. Better yet, if you fixed an issue or you have an improvement you'd like to share, send us a pull request.
